# Exploring-the-History-of-Lego
We use a variety of data manipulation techniques to explore different aspects of Lego's history.

### Project Description
The [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) database includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold; the names of these sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, and much more. The bricks may be small, but this is some big data! In this project, we examine the Rebrickable database and answer a series of questions related to the history of Lego.
